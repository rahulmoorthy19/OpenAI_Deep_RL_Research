## OpenAI Spinning Up Module

This is a Repository is designed to progress upon the the OpenAI road to being a RL Researcher module [link](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html). Along with this, it can also act as a code reference for future aspiring RL researchers. The main algorithms of which the implementation will be added to the repository are as follows-<br/>
1. Vanilla Policy Gradient- Done
2. DQN- Done
3. A2C- Done
4. PPO
5. DDPG

Along with this, the explanation of the algorithm and the concepts of RL has been explained in the PDF. It can be used as an additional reference for a starting point.

Software Requirements-
1. Tensorflow
2. Gym Environment Openai
3. Numpy
